            Mehn, it's so sadden a woman I called my wife has turn her back on me most especially in a period I needed her most, all because I am in a dare helpless and a caged situation. Honestly Catherine your excuse are flimsy, but it's all good.... it's all for the best you say. But at this moment I just want you to know that I feel entirely all alone.

            This on a long run will only make me stronger and better, I guess. The starvation or drought I am facing won't kill me. I won't be like this forever and trust me..... I promise, I will never give up.

            Thanks for everything. I think it's best we continue to keep this distance you've created. I tried to talk to you when I can... but I think I get your message. "Temy, stay on your own lane. We can't do this no more."...
        </p>
        <p>Still, I will always love you <span>Catherine</span> <em>â™¡</em>.</p>
